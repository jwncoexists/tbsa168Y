    Basic Class 1-68 will conduct a reunion of classmates in late April, 2015
    at Fredericksburg, Virginia. It has been nearly 48 years
    since we were together at Quantico -- a special occasion indeed.
    Sadly, 49 members of our class of 219 are no longer with us.
    We lost some in combat and others later in life. Each was taken too soon.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our mission is to contact the families of each of our 49 fallen to:
    <ul>
      <li>Assure them that they are remembered.
        We Marines have all sworn a solemn oath to honor
        those who have gone before us. Fittingly, the most important
        facet of our reunion is fulfilling this commitment to the
        families of our fallen Marine brothers; and
      </li>
      <li>Invite their family members to participate in reunion activities with us.
        memorial service that we will hold at the Vietnam Wall.
        Several of our widows have signed up early to join us and
        we hope many more will do so; and
      </li>
      <li>Gather life information about each of our fallen for a class booklet
        to be shared among our class members. There are many biographical
        gaps to be filled and shared among old friends who have lost touch
        over the many years.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    We have located all but one of the living members of our class,
    a heroic undertaking after all these years. Locating the families
    of our fallen remains a huge challenge.
  </p>

  <p>We are starting our family outreach search with this website and our
    Facebook page. Please contact us to let us know that we have reached
    one of our family members and to re-join our Marine Corps family.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dick Kurth is our point man for this mission.
  </p>

  <p>
    We look forward to your joining us.
